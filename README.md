The code for ICC workshop paper: **D**ecentralized **M**ultiagent Reinforcement Learning-based **C**ooperative **P**erception with Dual-functional Radar-Communication V2V Links, accepted in 2023 ICC ISAC Workshop

*The ever-increasing deployment of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) equipped with multiple radar transceivers increases the demand for both efficient environment sensing and reliable data sharing for safe driving. However, two challenges are observed for cooperative perception used in automotive scenarios, i.e., performance tradeoff between sensing and communication, as well as effective resource scheduling in the dynamic environment. In this paper, a fully decentralized multiagent reinforcement framework is developed to optimize cooperative perception based on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology. We first formulate the beamforming and power allocation problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Then we design a beacon signal to implement data broadcast and reformulate the problem
as a more general multiagent partially observed Markov decision process (POMDP). In this case, the dual-functional radarcommunication (DFRC) waveform can implement sensing and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) data exchange simultaneously without central nodes, mitigating interference and avoiding an extra communication resource demand. Numerical results show that our method is effective for real-time perception. It fairly provides identical quality of service (QoS) to all CAVs and achieves a low age of information (AoI) with minimal prior knowledge about the environment.*
